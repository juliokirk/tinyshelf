# tinyShelf

A (very) tiny book collection manager.




## What it does

tinyShelf is a lightweight, extremely simple command-line tool to manage book colletions and small libraries. It is completely built in Java and consists of direct prompts that guide the user through simple CRUD operations: adding, finding, updating and deleting books. The complete list of books is stored as a properly formatted JSON file inside the user's home folder.
